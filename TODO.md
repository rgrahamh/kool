# To-do list:

[X] Calling GameEngine.startGame() Initiates scene processing
[ ] GameEngine creates an instance of the Input class when created (Ryan H)
[ ] Input class keeps track of keyboard input (Ryan Houck)
[ ] Input class is passed to the scene (Ryan Houck)
[ ] Input class is accessible to game objects (Ryan Houck)
<<<<<<< HEAD
[X] GameEngine.setActiveScene, nextScene, prevScene, delScene all implemented (Jeremiah)
[ ] Create test Object child class for engine testing (Adam)

[ ] Rework setActiveScene so that game objects are able to change the active scene
[ ] Reorganize Hierarchy so that Sprites are more easily attached to Object subclasses prior to compilation. Currently Sprites are more closely associated with instances of Objects than Object classes.
